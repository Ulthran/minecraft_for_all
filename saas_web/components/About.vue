          <p>This is closer to a passion project than a business. I spent countless frustrated hours trying to set up Minecraft servers for me and a few friends through childhood and half the time I wouldn't succeed and we wouldn't play. I've also spent countless industrious hours building farms and playing the game I love on small servers other folks hosted and moderated without asking anything in return. I enable both -- friends playing with friends or strangers building community -- at a minimum of cost and effort.</p>

          <p>To make it easy for anyone to launch and manage their own Minecraft server, fostering creativity and community without the hassle or cost of traditional hosting solutions.</p>

          <p>This isn't a fancy operation. We're not in a position to be hosting 100 player servers or 100 mod servers and there are other services that can. What we can do really well is host a small, vanilla-ish server with any amount of uptime. If you and your friends get on once a week for a couple hours, you'll only pay for a couple hours of server time. Even if you have that one friend who AFKs for weeks on end at their quad-spawner spider farm so they can "escape the spider within," our prices will still be competitive.</p>
