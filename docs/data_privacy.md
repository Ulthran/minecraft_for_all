# Data Privacy

We are committed to safeguarding both your account details and any data stored on your Minecraft server. Only the minimal information required to run our service is collected.

## No Selling of Your Data

We never sell or share your personal information or server data with third parties. Details such as your email, payment information and world files are used solely so you can manage your server.

## Protections in Place

- **Whitelist/blacklist controls** allow you to explicitly permit or deny players.
- **DDoS mitigation** through AWS Shield and network firewalls helps keep your server online.
- Backups and logs are stored securely with restricted access.

Your worlds remain your property and can be deleted at any time from the console.
