# Branding

This document proposes a playful yet professional brand identity for the Minecraft hosting service.

## Name & Domain Ideas
Feedback suggested avoiding "Craft Pals" in favor of original names. Below are
some invented words with no apparent brand associations. Domains were checked
via `nslookup` and returned **NXDOMAIN** at the time of writing.

- **Phthimble** – whimsical and unique. Example domain: `phthimble.com`.
- **Xylblox** – references blocks without direct Minecraft usage. Example domain: `xylblox.com`.
- **Mubtor** – short and punchy. Example domain: `mubtor.io`.
- **Yivcraft** – playful yet readable. Example domain: `yivcraft.net`.
- **Loftrix** – suggests building and creativity. Example domain: `loftrix.com`.

## Tone and Personality
- **Goofy/friendly**: approachable language, bright accent colors.
- **Clean and professional**: straightforward layout with minimal clutter, easy navigation.

## Visual Concepts
- Pixel art styled after Minecraft textures.
- Personified block characters ("Block Buddy") acting as mascots.
- Primary palette: warm browns and greens with accent colors for a playful pop.

## Example Asset
`assets/block_mascot.png` – simple pixel art of a smiling block to serve as a placeholder mascot.

The asset can be expanded into animations or additional characters to populate the site.
