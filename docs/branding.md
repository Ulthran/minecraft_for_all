# Branding

This document proposes a playful yet professional brand identity for the Minecraft hosting service.

## Name & Domain Ideas
Feedback suggested avoiding "Craft Pals" in favor of original names. Below are
some invented words with no apparent brand associations. Domains were checked
via `nslookup` and returned **NXDOMAIN** at the time of writing.

- **Phthimble** – whimsical and unique. Example domain: `phthimble.com`.
- **Xylblox** – references blocks without direct Minecraft usage. Example domain: `xylblox.com`.
- **Mubtor** – short and punchy. Example domain: `mubtor.io`.
- **Yivcraft** – playful yet readable. Example domain: `yivcraft.net`.
- **Loftrix** – suggests building and creativity. Example domain: `loftrix.com`.

## Tone and Personality
- **Goofy/friendly**: approachable language, bright accent colors.
- **Clean and professional**: straightforward layout with minimal clutter, easy navigation.

## Visual Concepts
- Pixel art styled after Minecraft textures.
- Personified block characters ("Block Buddy") acting as mascots.
- Primary palette: warm browns and greens with accent colors for a playful pop.

### Emerald Block Buddy

💎 Emerald Block Creature – “Pricing & Billing Buddy”
Pixel Art Design Description

📦 Body
Shape: 16x16 square block, Minecraft-style.

Texture: Emerald block-style (not the ore), so:

Base color: Vibrant emerald green (#00C080 to #007750 gradient).

Subtle shimmering lines to resemble facets or the block’s beveled square pattern.

Add a few bright highlight streaks to suggest shininess.

😊 Face
Eyes: Larger, bright teal or white 2x2 eyes with twinkles (friendly, knowledgeable look).

Mouth: Small confident smile — this creature knows its math.

🦾 Arms & Legs (Stick-Figure Style)
Arms: Stick-style, 1 pixel wide, darker green or black.

Hands: Optional small “coin” or ledger in one hand (can be just a yellow circle or tan rectangle).

Legs: Positioned firmly — stable, like a reliable accountant.

Pose Suggestions:

One arm holding a “$” sign or a scroll.

One waving, one arm outstretched toward a pricing chart.

Standing on a small stack of coins (2-3 pixels tall).

✨ Cute Personality Fact
This little buddy loves spreadsheets and always balances your books — even if you accidentally bought 12 servers instead of one. Their favorite number is 64 (because that’s a stack!).

🧠 Function on Website
Pops up during plan selection, upgrade prompts, or when asking billing questions.

Can animate a wink or coin flip when hovering over premium features.

May say lines like:

“Looking for value? I’ve got stacks!”

“Need help choosing the right plan?”

### Redstone Block Buddy

Texture:

Deep crimson/red (#B00000 to #FF4040 range)

Subtle pulsing glow effect around the center using animated flicker or shifting red pixels

Optional circuit-pattern overlay (suggesting wiring, tech)

💡 You could add a single pixel "spark" drifting up every few frames for flair.

😊 Face
Eyes: Square pixel eyes with red irises or white pupils, suggesting focus/intensity

Expression: Confident grin or smirk — like someone who’s already solved the problem you’re about to have

Extra Detail: Maybe a pixel “visor” or one lens (like a monocle but futuristic)

🦾 Stick-Figure Limbs
Arms:

Stick-like (1 pixel wide), black or dark red

One arm raised with a gear or lever, the other holding a “tech scroll” or pointing to a toggle

Legs:

Slightly angled stance, like ready for action

Optional small red boots for fun

🔌 Speech Bubble Content Examples

🔥 Personality
💡 The tech-savvy engineer of your crew

Talks like a mix between a coder and a Minecraft tinkerer

Cute Fact: He once tried to wire your entire website with repeaters and comparators. It... almost worked.

🛠️ Website Role Ideas
Appears next to:

Configuration pages

Advanced server tools

Plugin toggles or scheduled tasks

Could animate slightly (glow flickers, blinking, holding a switch)

Background Suggestion (Optional Companion Scene)
Pixel-art Redstone lab backdrop:

Wires running on the ground

Pistons, levers, a redstone torch glowing

A repeater table in the corner

### Village Background

 Minecraft Village Background – Pixel Art Spec
🧱 1. Purpose
A backdrop for your block buddies (like the Iron or Emerald helper) to stand in front of, especially when:

Giving tips

Appearing in pop-ups

Standing near buttons or floating UI cards

It should not be a full scene but rather a partial diorama-style background, enough to give depth and context.

🎨 2. Dimensions
Default size: 128x64 or 128x96 pixels (scalable to fit buddy + bubble)

Tile Style: Still built on a 16x16 tile grid for visual consistency

Resolution: True pixel art, with block textures matching Minecraft (stone, wood, grass, etc.)

🏘️ 3. Visual Elements
🧱 Foreground (bottom half)
Path: Dirt or gravel with pixel shading (like Minecraft paths)

Foliage: A couple tufts of pixelated grass or a flower

Fence: Wooden fence posts (2–3 tiles wide) for framing

Villager House Wall: Cobblestone base with oak wood planks and window; maybe 1 door

🌳 Background (middle to top)
Sky: Flat blue with optional clouds (no dithering)

Tree Tops: Oak tree pixel canopy peeking in from the edge

Roof: One thatched/stair-stepped roof (partial, 3–4 tiles wide) behind the buddy

🎨 4. Pixelated Border (Edge Fade Effect)
Rough, irregular outline

~4–8 pixels of "fuzzy" edge blending into transparency

Uses scattered filler pixels (like blurred grass, sky speckles, etc.)

Maintains sharp pixel style, no gradients or anti-aliasing

Imagine it as a “cut-out” sticker feel — the background has been roughly popped out from a Minecraft world, and plopped behind your buddy.

🧩 5. Export/Usage Format
PNG with transparent background outside the faded edge

Works with both light and dark mode (dark site backdrop assumed)

Can be placed behind buddy + speech bubble or layered under popup panels

💡 Use Cases
Iron Buddy appears here when giving new user tips

Emerald Buddy stands in front of a villager house when explaining pricing

Future buddies (like a Slime Moderator) could get swamp or plains-themed variants
