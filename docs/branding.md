# Branding

This document proposes a playful yet professional brand identity for the Minecraft hosting service.

## Name & Domain Ideas
Feedback suggested avoiding "Craft Pals" in favor of original names. Below are
some invented words with no apparent brand associations. Domains were checked
via `nslookup` and returned **NXDOMAIN** at the time of writing.

- **Phthimble** – whimsical and unique. Example domain: `phthimble.com`.
- **Xylblox** – references blocks without direct Minecraft usage. Example domain: `xylblox.com`.
- **Mubtor** – short and punchy. Example domain: `mubtor.io`.
- **Yivcraft** – playful yet readable. Example domain: `yivcraft.net`.
- **Loftrix** – suggests building and creativity. Example domain: `loftrix.com`.

## Tone and Personality
- **Goofy/friendly**: approachable language, bright accent colors.
- **Clean and professional**: straightforward layout with minimal clutter, easy navigation.

## Visual Concepts
- Pixel art styled after Minecraft textures.
- Personified block characters ("Block Buddy") acting as mascots.
- Primary palette: warm browns and greens with accent colors for a playful pop.

### Emerald Block Buddy

💎 Emerald Block Creature – “Pricing & Billing Buddy”
Pixel Art Design Description

📦 Body
Shape: 16x16 square block, Minecraft-style.

Texture: Emerald block-style (not the ore), so:

Base color: Vibrant emerald green (#00C080 to #007750 gradient).

Subtle shimmering lines to resemble facets or the block’s beveled square pattern.

Add a few bright highlight streaks to suggest shininess.

😊 Face
Eyes: Larger, bright teal or white 2x2 eyes with twinkles (friendly, knowledgeable look).

Mouth: Small confident smile — this creature knows its math.

🦾 Arms & Legs (Stick-Figure Style)
Arms: Stick-style, 1 pixel wide, darker green or black.

Hands: Optional small “coin” or ledger in one hand (can be just a yellow circle or tan rectangle).

Legs: Positioned firmly — stable, like a reliable accountant.

Pose Suggestions:

One arm holding a “$” sign or a scroll.

One waving, one arm outstretched toward a pricing chart.

Standing on a small stack of coins (2-3 pixels tall).

✨ Cute Personality Fact
This little buddy loves spreadsheets and always balances your books — even if you accidentally bought 12 servers instead of one. Their favorite number is 64 (because that’s a stack!).

🧠 Function on Website
Pops up during plan selection, upgrade prompts, or when asking billing questions.

Can animate a wink or coin flip when hovering over premium features.

May say lines like:

“Looking for value? I’ve got stacks!”

“Need help choosing the right plan?”
